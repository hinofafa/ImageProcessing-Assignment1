# Comp4421 Image Processing - Assignment1

Topics: Image Enhancement in the Spatial and Frequency Domain

In this assignment, you need to finish two parts. The first one is to answer a simple
question, while the second part requires certain programming works using Matlab.
Please submit your answers of the first part in PDF format, and all relevant codes and
results of your second part together in a folder. Your PDF file and folder should be
named by your student ID. For example, if your student ID is “12345678”, then your
folder should be “12345678” and your PDF file should be “12345678.pdf”.

Remarks: This repository is the student ID folder and student ID pdf has been uploaded in 
there. Please read the Assignment_1.pdf carefully before using the Matlab program solution.
